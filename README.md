New changes bring new features without changing the entry or exit points of any methods or functions. You can safely upgrade without any changes to your existing codes.

Added feature:
1. Video recorder can be utilized with `server_auth` and `client_auth` auth tokens.
	* To specify them for recorder you should use `extraArgsForCreateVideo`
2. Video player can be utilized with `server_auth` and `client_auth` auth tokens.
	* To specify them for player you should use [method described bellow](#initialization-with-optional-authorization-token)

## Setup
- Create iOS App
- Add the following frameworks
	- AVFoundation.framework
	- Ziggeo.framework
- Make sure Ziggeo.framework is added to Embedded Binaries and Linked Framework sections in your app target settings

## Building/Packaging App
- Using `universal` framework is ideal for building apps that run on simulators and actual devices.
  See: iOS-Client-SDK/Output/ directory

## CocoaPods Support (optional)
- Install CocoaPods
  ```
  $ sudo gem install cocoapods
  ```
- Create new iOS project
- Init pods in the xcode project directory
  ```
  $ pod init
  ```
- Add framework to Podfile
  ```
  pod 'iOS-Client-SDK', :git => 'https://github.com/Ziggeo/iOS-Client-SDK.git'
  ```
- Install framework
  ```
  $ pod install
  ```
- Reopen the project using the .xcworkspace

## Preparing App for submission to App Store
- Create "new run script phase" in the application target build settings to strip unused architectures. Use the script provided with the iOS-Client-SDK/TestApp_ example (TestApp target settings -> Build phases -> Run script section)


# Basic Usage
## Initialize Application
```
#import "Ziggeo/Ziggeo.h"

Ziggeo* m_ziggeo = [[Ziggeo alloc] initWithToken:@"ZIGGEO_APP_TOKEN" Delegate:self];];
```

## Usage
### Record Video
```
    [m_ziggeo record];
```

Add audio category setup to enable playback and recording while application is in silent mode. This category will also allow to record background audio.
```
//AppDelegate.m
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord
                                     withOptions:AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDuckOthers | AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker
                                           error:nil];
    return YES;
}
```

### Play Video With Token
```
[m_ziggeo playVideo:@"VIDEO_TOKEN"];
```

### Play Video With Url
```
[m_ziggeo playFromUri:Video_Url];
```

### Record Audio
```
[m_ziggeo startAudioRecorder];
```

### Play Audio
```
[m_ziggeo startAudioPlayer:@"AUDIO_TOKEN"];
```

### Record Image
```
[m_ziggeo startImageRecorder];
```

### Show Image
```
[m_ziggeo showImage:@"IMAGE_TOKEN"];
```

### Start Screen Recorder
```
[m_ziggeo startScreenRecorder];
```

### Upload From Path
```
[m_ziggeo uploadFromPath:@"FILE_PATH" :@{}];
```

### Upload From File Selector
```
NSMutableDictionary *data = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
//data[@"media_types"] = @[@"video", @"audio", @"image"];
[m_ziggeo uploadFromFileSelector:data];
```

### Cancel Uploading
```
[m_ziggeo cancelUpload:path :delete_file];
```

### Start QR Scanner
```
[m_ziggeo startQrScanner:@{}];
```


## Config

NSDictionary *config = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"iOS_Choose_Media" forKey:@"tags"];
[m_ziggeo setUploadingConfig:config];
```

### Streaming Recording
```
[m_ziggeo setLiveStreamingEnabled:YES];
```
Streaming recording mode will upload the video stream during the recording without caching to local file first. Video preview and video re-record are not available in this mode.

### Autostart Recording After
```
[m_ziggeo setAutostartRecordingAfter:0];
```

### Start Delay
```
[m_ziggeo setStartDelay:0];
```

### Extra Argment For Recorder
```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
map[@"blur_effect"] = @"false";
map[@"effect_profile"] = @"12345";
map[@"data"] = @{@"foo": @"bar"};
map[@"client_auth"] = @"CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN";
map[@"server_auth"] = @"SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN";
[m_ziggeo setExtraArgsForRecorder:map];
```

### Extra Argment For Recorder
```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
map[@"hideRecorderControls"] = @"false";
[m_ziggeo setThemeArgsForRecorder:map];
```

### Enable Cover Selector Dialog
```
[m_ziggeo setCoverSelectorEnabled:YES];
```

### Capture Duration Limit
```
[m_ziggeo setMaxRecordingDuration:20];
```

### Set Video Width

```
[m_ziggeo setSendImmediately:YES];
```

### Set Recording Quality
```
//[m_ziggeo setQuality:LowQuality];
[m_ziggeo setQuality:MediumQuality];
