Added feature:
1. Video recorder can be utilized with `server_auth` and `client_auth` auth tokens.
	* To specify them for recorder you should use `extraArgsForCreateVideo`
2. Video player can be utilized with `server_auth` and `client_auth` auth tokens.
	* To specify them for player you should use [method described bellow](#initialization-with-optional-authorization-token)

## Setup
- Create iOS App
- Add the following frameworks
	- AVFoundation.framework
	- Ziggeo.framework
- Make sure Ziggeo.framework is added to Embedded Binaries and Linked Framework sections in your app target settings

## Building/Packaging App
- Using `universal` framework is ideal for building apps that run on simulators and actual devices.
  See: _iOS-Client-SDK/Ziggeo/Output/ directory

## Preparing App for submission to App Store
- Create "new run script phase" in the application target build settings to strip unused architectures. Use the script provided with the _iOS-Client-SDK/TestApp_ example (TestApp target settings -> Build phases -> Run script section)


# Basic Usage
## Initialize Application

```
#import "Ziggeo/Ziggeo.h"

Ziggeo* m_ziggeo = [[Ziggeo alloc] initWithToken:@"ZIGGEO_APP_TOKEN"];
```

## Video Player

### Initialization
```
- (ZiggeoPlayer*)createPlayer {
    return [[ZiggeoPlayer alloc] initWithZiggeoApplication:m_ziggeo videoToken:@"ZIGGEO_VIDEO_TOKEN"];
}
```

Add audio category setup to enable playback and recording while application is in silent mode. This category will also allow to record background audio.

```
//AppDelegate.m
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord
                                     withOptions:AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDuckOthers | AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker
                                           error:nil];
    return YES;
}
```


### Initialization with optional authorization token
```
    [ZiggeoPlayer createPlayerWithAdditionalParams:m_ziggeo videoToken:@"VIDEO_TOKEN" params:@{ @"client_auth" : @"CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN" } callback:^(ZiggeoPlayer *player) {
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            AVPlayerViewController* playerController = [[AVPlayerViewController alloc] init];
            playerController.player = player;
            [self presentViewController:playerController animated:true completion:nil];
            [playerController.player play];
        });
    }];
```

### Fullscreen Playback
```
    AVPlayerViewController* playerController = [[AVPlayerViewController alloc] init];
    playerController.player = [self createPlayer];
    [self presentViewController:playerController animated:true completion:nil];
    [playerController.player play];
```

### Embedded Playback
```
    ZiggeoPlayer* player = [self createPlayer];
    AVPlayerLayer* playerLayer = [AVPlayerLayer playerLayerWithPlayer:player];
    playerLayer.frame = self.videoViewPlaceholder.frame;
    [self.videoViewPlaceholder.layer addSublayer:playerLayer];
    [player play];
```

## Video Recorder

```
    ZiggeoRecorder* recorder = [[ZiggeoRecorder alloc] initWithZiggeoApplication:m_ziggeo];
    [self presentViewController:recorder animated:true completion:nil];
```

## ZiggeoRecorder (Beta)
New recorder rewritten from scratch. Allows to record video and audio without interrupting 3rd party apps playback (Music app, for example). Some additional setup required for simultaneous recording, see TestApp->AppDelegate.m for details.
```
    ZiggeoRecorder* recorder = [[ZiggeoRecorder alloc] initWithZiggeoApplication:m_ziggeo];
    [self presentViewController:recorder animated:true completion:nil];
```

### Capture Duration Limit
```
    ZiggeoRecorder* recorder = [[ZiggeoRecorder alloc] initWithZiggeoApplication:m_ziggeo];
	recorder.videoMaximumDuration = 20; //optional capture duration limit
    [self presentViewController:recorder animated:true completion:nil];
```

### Enable Cover Selector Dialog
```
    recorder.coverSelectorEnabled = YES;
```

### Select Existing Video Instead of Capturing a New One

```
    [recorder selectExistingVideo];
```

### Disable Camera Flip Button

```
    recorder.cameraFlipButtonVisible = NO;
```

### Set Active Camera Device

```
    recorder.cameraDevice = UIImagePickerControllerCameraDeviceRear;
```

### Set Recording Quality

```
    recorder.recordingQuality = mediumQuality;
    //recorder.recordingQuality = lowQuality;
    //recorder.recordingQuality = highestQuality;
```

### Enable Face Outlining
```
recorder.showFaceOutline = YES;
```

### Enable Light Meter Indicator
```
recorder.showLightIndicator = YES;
```

### Enable Audio Level Indicator
```
recorder.showSoundIndicator = YES;
```

### Custom Create Video Parameters (like effects, profiles, etc)

```
    recorder.extraArgsForCreateVideo = @{ @"effect_profile" : @"12345" };
```

### Custom User Data
```
    recorder.extraArgsForCreateVideo = @{@"data": @"{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"}; 
```

### Authorization tokens

Recorder-level auth tokens:
```
    recorder.extraArgsForCreateVideo = @{ @"client_auth" : @"CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN" };
    recorder.extraArgsForCreateVideo = @{ @"server_auth" : @"SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN" };
```

Global (application-level) auth tokens:
```
    m_ziggeo.connect.clientAuthToken = @"CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN";
    m_ziggeo.connect.serverAuthToken = @"SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN";
```

### Custom Recorder UI

```
    recorder.showsCameraControls = NO;
    recorder.cameraOverlayView = some_view;
```
Since ZiggeoRecorder is a subclass of UIImagePickerController, it is possible to use any standard ways to create custom camera UI. Please check CustomUITestApp example and this Apple tutorial for more details: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/PhotoPicker/Introduction/Intro.html 

### Streaming Recording
```
    recorder.useLiveStreaming = YES;
```
Streaming recording mode will upload the video stream during the recording without caching to local file first. Video preview and video re-record are not available in this mode.

### Delegate

# Advanced SDK usage

# Ziggeo API access
You can use the SDK to access Ziggeo Server API methods in the async manner. The SDK provides next functionality:
- Create/remove/index videos
- Custom Ziggeo Embedded Server API requests 

All the API methods are working asynchronously and never blocking the calling thread. You may optionally use custom callbacks (completion blocks) to receive the results.


## Videos API

### Get Video Accessor Object
```
    ZiggeoVideos* videos = [m_ziggeo videos];
```

### Get All Videos
```
    [videos getVideos:^(NSArray *jsonArray, NSError *error) {
        //the completion block will be executed asynchronously on the response received
    }];
```

### Create New Video
#### Basic
```
	[videos createVideoWithData:nil file:videoPath cover:nil callback:nil Progress:nil];
```

#### Advanced
You can add your custom completion/progress callbacks here to make the SDK inform your app about uploading progress and response. Cover image is optional and could be nil, making Ziggeo platform to generate default video cover
```
    [videos uploadVideoWithPath:videoPath Callback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {

    } Progress:^(int totalBytesSent, int totalBytesExpectedToSend) {

    } ConfirmCallback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        
    }];
```

### Delete Video
```
	[videos deleteVideoByToken:videoToken StreamToken:streamToken Callback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {

    }];
```

### Get Video URL for Your Own Custom Player
```
    NSURL* videoURL = [NSURL URLWithString:[videos getVideoUrlWithVideoToken:token]];
```

### Get Remote Video Thumbnail asynchronously
Remote video thumbs are cached on client side, so you can call the method as frequently as you wish without the performance or network load impact
```
    [videos getImageForVideoByToken:videoToken Data:(NSDictionary *)data 
        Callback:^(UIImage *image, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {

    }];
```

### Generate Local Video Thumbnail asynchronously
Local video thumbs are cached on client side, so you can call the method as frequently as you wish without the performance impact
```
    [m_ziggeo.videos getImageForVideoByPath:localVideoPath 
        Callback:^(UIImage *image, NSError *error) {
            // update UI with the received image
    }];
```


## Audios API

### Get Audio Accessor Object
```
    ZiggeoAudios* audios = [m_ziggeo audios];
```

### Get All Audios
```
    [audios getAudios:^(NSArray *jsonArray, NSError *error) {
        // the completion block will be executed asynchronously on the response received
    }];
```

### Upload Audio
```
    [audios uploadAudioWithPath:audioPath Callback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        
    } Progress:^(int totalBytesSent, int totalBytesExpectedToSend) {
        
    } ConfirmCallback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        
    }];
```

### Delete Video
```
	[audios deleteAudioByToken:audioToken 
        Callback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {

    }];
```


## Image API

### Get Image Accessor Object
```
    ZiggeoImages* images = [m_ziggeo images];
```

### Get All Images
```
    [images getImages:^(NSArray *jsonArray, NSError *error) {
        // the completion block will be executed asynchronously on the response received
    }];
```

### Upload Image
```
    [images uploadImageWithPath:imagePath Callback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        
    } Progress:^(int totalBytesSent, int totalBytesExpectedToSend) {
        
    } ConfirmCallback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        
    }];

or

    [images uploadImageWithPath:imageFile Callback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        
    } Progress:^(int totalBytesSent, int totalBytesExpectedToSend) {
        
    } ConfirmCallback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
        
    }];
```

### Delete Image
```
	[images deleteImageByToken:imageToken 
        Callback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {

    }];
```


## Custom Ziggeo API Requests
The SDK provides an opportunity to make custom requests to Ziggeo Embedded Server API. You can make POST/GET/custom_method requests and receive RAW data, json-dictionary or string as the result.

### Get API Accessor Object
```
ZiggeoConnect* connection = [m_ziggeo connect];
```

### Make POST Request and Parse JSON Response
```
[connection postJsonWithPath:path Data:(NSDictionary *)data 
	Callback:^(NSDictionary *jsonObject, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    	//  jsonObject contains parsed json response received from Ziggeo API Server
	}
];
```

### Make POST Request and Get RAW Data Response
```
[connection postWithPath:path Data:(NSDictionary*)data 
	Callback:^(NSData *data, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    	// data object contains raw data response received from Ziggeo API Server
	}
];
```

### Make GET Request and Get String Response
```
[connection getStringWithPath:path Data:(NSDictionary*)data 
	Callback:^(NSString *string, NSURLResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    	// the string contains stringified response received from Ziggeo API Server
	}
];
```
